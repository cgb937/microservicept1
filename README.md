 Fahrenheit to Celsius and Kelvin Converter API
 
 This microservice is an API endpoint that receives an HTTP POST with a URL encoded in Fahrenheit. It will then convert the temperature in celsius and kelvin. 

Requirements

Node.js
Express
IDE of choice - I used VS code


Installation

Clone this repository from Git hub
Install dependencies using npm and navigating to the file. Start the server.


Once the service is up and running on Express, go to the specified port.
On the local port, you can use the API by sending an HTTP POST request with the temperature in Fahrenheit. The service will respond with the temperature converted to Celsius and Kelvin.

 You can programmatically request data from the microserivce using a POST request and you can receive data programatically by parsing the JSON response (which is a requirement that it is in JSON) from the POST request. 
 
 You must use node and express which is a requirement of Estevan's project.
